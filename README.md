# CropSentry
This project introduces an agricultural robot with dynamic sizing, autonomously inspecting crops and providing real-time data on deficiencies, diseases, and weeds. Users interact via a website, guiding the robot to inspection areas. The robot offers prescriptive solutions and data insights, revolutionizing farming by filling the real-time data gap.
